(David K. Johns et al. eds., CLE in Colo., Inc. Supp. 2015).</p>\n<p>Joint Representation: Ethical and Other Considerations.</p>\n<p>The attorney representing the principal may want to keep in mind that, just as the principal must have the requisite capacity to execute the power of attorney, so must the principal possess the capacity to waive awaivableconflict of interest.SeeA. Rosenberg, “Being of Sound Mind: Standards for Testamentary (and Other) Capacity,” 40Colo. Law.89 (July 2011).</p>\n<p>Prior to execution of the power of attorney (POA), the attorney may wish to discuss with the principal whether it is appropriate to waive confidentiality in the context of the attorney communicating with the principal’s agent. A specific or general grant of authority from principal to agent may be appropriate for this purpose. Opinions vary about the scope of such a waiver, and the attorney may wish to read the Uniform Power of Attorney Act at C.R.S. § 15-14-714 regarding reasonably inferred duties imposed on an agent, and likening the duties to those of a conservator.</p>\n<p>The attorney may want to consider adding the following text to the power ofattorney:</p>\n<p>I have great trust and confidence in my agent. I believe that my agent and I have a common purpose in providing for my support in the event of my incapacity. To avoid unnecessary legal expense, I authorize my attorney to discuss matters with my agent if my attorney determines that such discussion is in my best interest and consistent with the Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct. This paragraph should not be interpreted as restricting my agent from selecting an attorney of my agent’s choice.</p>\n<p>If the attorney agrees to direct, advise,or represent the agent, the attorney may want to inform the agent of the agent’s legal obligations, including fiduciary obligations arising from the agent’s acceptance of the position of (taking responsibility for actions as) agent for the principal.SeeD. Whitmer, “The Durable Power of Attorney: Defining the Agent’s Duties,” 41Colo. Law. 49 (May 2012). The attorney may wish to consider that educating an agent as to his or her fiduciary duties can be a powerful tool to prevent financial mismanagement or inadvertent abuse.SeeL.Whitton, “The Uniform Power of Attorney Act: Striking a Balance Between Autonomy and Protection,” 1Phoenix L. Rev. 343, 355 (Spring2008).</p>\n<p>The attorney drafting the POA may be contacted by the agent for assistance or advice regarding the document. It is advisable to clarify the role of the attorney, and who is the attorney’s client or clients, particularly if the attorney will be engaged to represent joint or multiple parties. The attorney may wish to consider the following at the outset of the representation and continuing throughout the representation: (1) whether the joint representationinvolves counseling or advocacy,(2) who is the client as identified in the engagement letter,(3) the nature of the services contemplated and on whose behalf such work is to be performed,and (4) appropriate communication for obtaining informed consent from all represented persons.</p>\n<p>The attorney may wish to advise the clients from the outset who the attorney is representing, so that it will remain clear to theattorney as well as the client who the primaryclient is, as well as to whom the duty of confidentiality is owed and the circumstances under which an attorney may continue to represent multiple clients in the event of a conflict that iswaivableand to which consent has been given. Awaivableconflict is distinguished from a conflict of interest that requires the attorney to withdraw from representation.SeeColo. RPC1.7. Comments[] to [] of Colo. RPC 1.7, “Special Considerations in Common Representation,” arealso instructive.</p>\n<p>In the case of joint or multiple representation, clients do not usually understand the application of the duty of confidentiality as well as other duties arising from the attorney-client relationship, so the lawyer may want to carefully explain thenature of the representation, along with its relationship to other duties that may be relevant in a joint or multiple representation context. With regard to the duty of loyalty, counseling prior to entering into representation and the signature of a specifically drafted engagement letter can adequately address thisin most cases. Concerning conflicts of interest, the attorney may want to include a specific provision in the engagement letter to explain to clients in the informed consent context about the alternatives in representing a client as principal and concurrently an agent who is a family member. For sample language, see Notes on Use3, 4, and 5of Tab Ca. The attorney may want to consider using an engagement letter that can be specifically drafted to adequately address this issue.</p>\n<p>The attorney may wish to consider clarifying the concurrent fiduciary responsibilities where an agent consults the attorney for the principal. These inherent conflicts may arise in the context of representing husband and wife orelder parent and adultchild, andshould be considered before undertaking representation and monitored throughout the representation.SeeS.Zimring, “Ethical Issues in Representing Seniors, Persons with Disabilities and Their Families,” 4NAELA J. 125, 133 (2008). For further reading, seeCBA Ethics Committee Formal Opinion No. 68,“Conflicts of Interest: Propriety of Multiple Representation,”41Colo. Law.17 (March 2012), whichcontains a discussion relevant to waiver of apotentialconflict of interest, andwhichquotesInre Guardianship of Lillian P., 617 N.W.2d 849, 856 (Wis. App. 2000):</p>\n<p>An effective waiver of a conflict or potential conflict of interest which is knowing and voluntary requires the lawyer to disclose the following: (1) the existence of all conflicts or potential conflicts in the representation; (2) the nature of the conflicts or potential conflicts, in relationship to the lawyer’s representation of the client’s interests; and (3) that the exercise of the lawyer’s independent professional judgment could be affected by the lawyer’s own interests or those of another client. On the part of the client, it also requires: (1) an understanding of the conflicts or potential conflicts and how they could affect the lawyer’s representation of the client; (2) an understanding of the risks inherent in the dual representation then under consideration; and (3) the ability to choose other representation.</p>\n<p>Id., 41Colo. Law.at 18.</p>\n<p>The social security numbers for the principal and the agent were included on the prior form.Because of identity theft concerns, it is not recommended that the principal’s or the agent’s social security numbers be included on the power of attorney, but the agent may need to supply those numbers to third parties.</p>\n<p>Detailed descriptions of general powers are set out in thenewAct in C.R.S.§§15-14-727 through -739, andpractitionersmay want to simply incorporate themby reference, as illustrated inalternative 1 of paragraph 3.Onecould also include the description of the powers in the power of attorney, as listed inalternative 2.Some practitioners believe this is more helpful to the agent.Also keep in mind that the general grant of authority in paragraph 1 authorizes the agent to exercise all the powers listed in C.R.S.§§15-14-727 through -739 whether or not the powers are referenced in paragraph 3.If the practitioner intends to exclude any of the general powers, paragraph 1 must be revised accordingly.</p>\n<p>The power to support family members and others included as Paragraph 3.13 in Alternative 2, as well as C.R.S. § 15-14-736, is part of an agent’s general powers, and is not designated as a “hot power” under the statute.Nevertheless, it conveys considerable authority to transfer assets of the principal for the benefit of third parties.In appropriate circumstances, the practitioner may want to consider explicitly limiting or denying this authority in the instrument.</p>\n<p>This power broadly authorizes an agent to satisfy a principal’s support obligations towards a spouse, children, other legal dependants, and “individuals whom the principal has customarily supported or indicated the intent to support.”The latter category is undefined and could conceivably include unmarried partners, under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing food, shelter,and support for persons in the categories above, an agent is authorized to pay for their “normal” domestic help, vacations, travel expenses, educational expenses, healthcare,andtransportation (including automobile maintenance and insurance),and to “maintain” credit and debit accounts for their “convenience.”Dues for the principal’s membership in professional, religious, civic,or other organizations are also authorized,as arecontributions to those organizations.</p>\n<p>Authority to make payments under this section does not require the instrument to include gifting powers under C.R.S. § 15-14-740.However, this section should not be interpreted as a warrant for emptying the principal’s coffers for the benefit of third parties.The agent’s primary fiduciary relationship and duty of loyalty to the principal under C.R.S. § 15-14-714 remain in place.</p>\n<p>Power to DealWithMineral Interests:Specific authority to deal with mineralinterests is not included in the text of the form, and although it may be included in the general authority to deal with real property, specific language may be advisable for a client who owns significant mineral or oil and gas interests. If this is desired the following language could be used:</p>\n<p>To grant, bargain, sell, convey and lease for oil, gas,and mineral purposes any and all real estatethatI may own or in which I may possess any interest, wherever situate, for such price and on such termsasmy agent deems best, and to make, execute, acknowledge,and deliver good and sufficient documents of conveyance for thesame, with or without covenants of warranty; to sell, assign, transfer,and convey any and all oil and gas leases and royalty and mineral intereststhatI may own or in which I may possess any interest, wherever situate, for such consideration and on such terms as my agent deems best, and to execute good and sufficient assignments and conveyances for the same; to execute any and all necessary division orders, transfer orders,and similar instruments; to release and surrender any and all non-producing oil and gas leases in which I may own an interest.</p>\n<p>Powers Regarding Sophisticated Investment Transactions:Specific authority for sophisticated financial investments and transactions is not included in thisparagraph.The addition of powers to engage in such transactions should be specific to the needs of the client. Sophisticated transactions include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>a)Put/calls,index options trading, andLEAPS-long term options;</p>\n<p>b)Currency tradingandcurrency options;</p>\n<p>c)Foreignmarkets;</p>\n<p>d)Commodity futuresandcommodity futures options;</p>\n<p>e)Real estate investment trusts (“REIT”) and real estate mortgage investment conduits (“REMIC”);</p>\n<p>f)Derivatives; and</p>\n<p>g)Over-the-counter“penny stock.”</p>\n<p>Brokerage compliance departments and transfer houses have become morerestrictive in acceptance of a power of attorney because of past history of abused authority and wrongful transactions by attorneys-in-fact. Transfer agents are especially reluctant to allow the attorney-in-fact to engage in sophisticated transactions listed above unless those powers are specifically designated in the governing document. It is widely recognized that these sophisticated transactions are normally speculative and inherently risky. Because of this extensive risk, counsel usually should not include such speculative powers in the governing documents without due consideration of the client’s specific circumstances. Counsel may encounter clients who are using sophisticated transactions to speculate. In such case, the attorney-in-fact should not be encouraged to continue to speculate. Counsel should consider limiting the sophisticated security powers to those that will mitigate speculative positions previously taken by the principal.</p>\n<p>When encountering a principal that is utilizing any of the sophisticated transactions listed above, counsel should not automatically assume the principal is speculating and taking undue risk, because practices of a number of industries include the use of such sophisticated transactions to hedge liability to reduce the overall risk. This practice should not be confused with speculation. Examples include agricultural operations that produce the product that would be purchased or sold on a futures or commodities market. To continue the prudent use of suchsophisticated transactions to enhance the overall business operation, the agent must be given the particular powers to do so in the power of attorney.</p>\n<p>Forsellingsecurities, the power to“sell, assign and transfer”in the specific market (i.e., (a) through (g),above) should be spelled out in the power of attorney to be acceptable to most issuers transferring securities. Forbuyingsecurities, so long as purchases are reasonably prudent and suitable for the principal, most powers of attorney include general authority for agents to invest for their principal. Speculative or risky security purchases require more specific power of attorney language for the added risk. Selling short requires specific power of attorney language. General language in a power of attorney willnotauthorize agents to pledge trust collateral, get loans,or trade on margin. If the principal has a business need of trading on margin, the specific authority for the agent to continue the practice must be included in the power of attorney. Most compliance departments arenow requiring prior approval of the power of attorney for margin or loan accounts or for the other sophisticated investments listed above.</p>\n<p>Powers Regarding Tax Matters:The new act at C.R.S.§15-14-739 includes a general grant of authority to deal with tax matters, and this authority was apparently intended to cover all powers that the agent would need to address the principals dealings with taxing authorities.However, it is possible that this statute does not include the specific authority to execute a Form 2848 or Form 907 as required in the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations.The power described in Alternative 2(16) of paragraph 3 includes that specific reference.The following language was contained in the prior notes on use, and includes authority to signIRSForm 2848,“Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative.”Note, however, that this language has been held insufficient to authorize a taxpayers representative to signIRSForm 907,“Agreement to Extend Period of Limitations,”in the absence of additional language containing this specific authorization.SeeRev. Rul. 76-60, 1976-1 C.B. 387. Currently, a power of attorney must be filed with the IRS in order for the agent to receive a check in payment of any refund of taxes, including penalties and interest; the execution of a waiver of restriction on assessment or collection of a deficiency, or a waiver of notice of disallowance of a refund claim; the execution of a consent to extend the assessment or collection;or for executing an IRS closing agreement. New procedural rules governing powers of attorney appear in Treas. Reg.§§601.501 through 601.509.</p>\n<p>ALTERNATIVE FOR TAX POWERS:</p>\n<p>To executeIRSForm 2848 or any power of attorney form required by the Internal Revenue Service, including covering any tax years; to prepare, sign,and file federal, state, or local income, gift, other tax returns of all kinds, FICA returns, payroll tax returns, claims for refunds, requests for extensions of time, ruling requests, petitions to the tax court or other courts regarding tax matters, andany and all other tax related documents, including, without limitation, receipts, offers, waivers, consents (including, but not limited to, consents and agreements under I.R.C.§2032A, or any successor section thereto), closing agreements,and any power of attorney form required by the Internal Revenue Service, state taxing authority, or other taxing body with respect to any tax period; to consent to extension of any limitation of action relating to assessments; to pay taxes due, collect refunds, post bonds, receive confidential information,and contest deficiencies determined by the Internal Revenue Service, state taxing authority, or other taxing body; to exercise any elections I may have under federal, state, or local tax law; and generally to represent me in all tax matters and proceedings of all kinds and for all periods before or after the date of this delegation, before all offices and officers of the Internal Revenue Service, state taxing authority, and any other taxing body. I authorize my agent to substitute a representative and to delegate authority to a new representative and to retain and discharge professional counsel.</p>\n<p>Under thenewAct at C.R.S.§15-14-724, certain powers must be specifically granted (the so-called“hot powers”), and those are listed in the form with blanks for the principal to initial, in order to grant them to the agent under thispower ofattorney.The practitioner should keep in mind that some of the hot powers may be needed simply to implement general powers.For example, an agent with general authority regarding insurance and annuities does not have the authority to create or change a beneficiary designation without an express grant of that authority as one of the“hot powers.”Or,an agent with general authority regarding banks and financial institutions would not be able to create a survivorship interest on an account without an express grant of that authority in the“hot powers.”Whenever grant of express authority is considered, it is important to balance the property management benefits against the potential for abuse.</p>\n<p>In addition to the “hot powers” of C.R.S. § 15-14-724, C.R.S. § 15-14-711(2) recognizes the principal’s right to grant the agent or other individual the authority to appoint a successor or “substitute agent.” The Power of Attorney form at paragraph 4.14 includes a line for the principal to initial to grant the power to “name one or more successor agents.” This power is neither a hot power nor an inherent power of theagent, butmust be specifically granted by the principal. Counsel should note that third parties such as banks and brokerage firms may be reluctant to accept a successor agent appointed under such a provision. To help encourage acceptance, it is recommended that the instrument of appointment by the agent of a successor or substitute specifically identifies the provision of the power of attorney that grants the agent the authority and identifies and incorporates C.R.S. § 15-14-711(2). Consider the following form for use in designating a successor agent:</p>\n<p>APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR AGENT</p>\n<p>Under the Power of Attorney of [Name of principal]</p>\n<p>Colorado Revised Statutes section 15-14-711(2) recognizes the right of a Principal of a Power of Attorney to grant the Agent the power to appoint Successor agents.</p>\n<p>The Power of Attorney of [Name of Principal] at section 4, Paragraph 4.14 specifically grants the Agent the right to name one or more successor agents.</p>\n<p>I, [Name of Agent], appointed as the Agent under the Power of Attorney of [Name of Principal] datedby this instrument appoint [Name of Successor Agent] as successor agent of the Power of Attorney of [Name of Principal].</p>\n<p>The following are examples of alternative language for determination of when the successor shall act:</p>\n<p>1)Upon my written resignation as Agent,the successor named above shall become successor agent upon acceptance of the role of agent under the referenced power of attorney.</p>\n<p>2)On ___ day of _____________, 20__, I temporarily resign as Agent of the above referenced power of attorney,and upon acceptance of the role of Agent the successor named above shall become Agent and shall continue to be Agent until ___ day of ____________, 20__, at which time I shall resume the role of Agent.</p>\n<p>3)The successor named above shall become Agent if the named Agent is unable or unwilling to fulfill the role of agent and upon acceptance of the role of Agent by the successor.</p>\n<p>Signed this _____ day of _________________, 20__.</p>\n<p>Name of Agent</p>\n<p>The practitioner should note that the statute contemplates the power of an agent to appoint a successor agent. However, the statute is silent as to the form, terms,and circumstances that this appointment should take. The form above gives several optional suggestions as to how the appointment may be implemented. Consideration should be given as to when and under what circumstances the successor will take over.</p>\n<p>If the principal has designated a successor agent in the power of attorney,the practitioner should advise the principal to coordinate the provision designating a successor agent and the provision allowing the agent to designate a successor. If both provisions are included in the document,a clear statement of whether a successor appointed by the principal has priority should also be included.</p>\n<p>The suggested provision below gives priority to the appointment of a successor agent that is designated by the principal:</p>\n<p>If my agent ceases to serve due to death, incapacity, resignation, or other cause, I appoint _____________ of __________________ as successor agent. In the event that the designated successor agent is unable or unwilling to serve in this capacity my agent may name one or more successor agents as authorized by C.R.S. §15-14-711(2).</p>\n<p>Note that ifan agent is given the power to appoint a successor agent there may exist separate appointments of successor agents by different acting agents. If multiple agents appoint multiple successors this can create significant confusion and may lead to court involvement. Practitioners are advised to consider this problem when drafting and advising the principal or agent.</p>\n<p>C.R.S. § 15-14-711 also includes a provision that, unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney, either co-agent may act alone on behalf of the principal. Note that third parties may show a reluctance toread the entire instrument to ensure there is no provision that “otherwise” provides that a co-agent may act alone. In addition, many third parties may question their legal skills in identifying such a provision. Counsel may consider adding the following to a designation of co-agent for the purpose of facilitating acceptance of the co-agents’ ability to act alone:</p>\n<p>Co-Agents under this Power of Attorney may act alone on my behalf.</p>\n<p>In the alternative, if the principal desires that the co-agents be required to act together, then counsel may consider adding the following:</p>\n<p>Co-Agents under this Power of Attorney must act together on my behalf.</p>\n<p>C.R.S. § 15-14-724(2) contains additional restrictions with respect to exercise of the “hot powers” that could significantly impact a power of attorney prepared for a client in a nontraditional family. That section provides that if the agent is “not an ancestor, spouse, or descendant of the principal,” the agent may not exercise the powers to create an interest in the agent or an individual to whom the agentowes a legal obligation of support.Under C.R.S. § 14-15-107(1), such restriction would likewise apply to a partner in a civil union.In a nontraditional family, specific power for the agent to benefit himself or herself may be advisable with particular attention to gifting powers.SeeNote 11 belowandTab D, “Gifting.”</p>\n<p>In general, the General Durable Power of Attorney form is drafted for traditional, opposite sex couples with language throughout referencing spouse, family, children, etc. When working with non-traditional individuals or couples, the practitioner may want to modify some of the language to fit the situation,including what are and are not legally recognized relationships. For example, do both parents have a legal relationship with their children so that the children are included in the definition of family (see paragraph 3.13 under Alternative 2,which refers to “my spouse,”“my children,” etc.) or beneficiary (seeparagraph 4.1 undersection4).</p>\n<p>Powers of Collection and Payment:Specific authority may be given to an agent to forgive or attempt to recover money and interests due the principal. An illustrative provision is the following:</p>\n<p>To forgive, request, demand, sue for, recover, collect, receive,orhold all such sums of money, debts, dues, commercial paper, checks, drafts, accounts, deposits, legacies, bequests, devises, notes, interests, stock certificates, bonds, dividends, certificates of deposit, annuities, pension, profit sharing, retirement, social security, insurance,and other contractual benefits and proceeds; all documents of title, all property, real or personal, intangible and tangible property,and property rights and demands whatsoever, liquidated orunliquidated, now or hereafter owned by, or due, owing, payable,or belonging to me, or in which I have or may hereafter acquire an interest, to have, use,and take all lawful means and equitable and legal remedies and proceedings in my name for the collection and recovery thereof, and to adjust, sell, compromise, and agree for the same, and to execute and deliver for me, on my behalf and in my name, all endorsements, releases, receipts, or other sufficient discharges for the same; to execute or release deeds of trust or other security agreements as may be necessary or proper in the exercise of the rights and powers herein granted.</p>\n<p>Gifting powers are one of the powers that must be specifically listed, but if only a general grant to make gifts is included in the power of attorney, those gifts are subject to the restrictions under C.R.S.§15-14-740, including the limit of gifts to the gift tax annual exclusion.Tab D,“Gifting,”includes a separatelimitedpower ofattorney just for gifting that grants broader powers than those in§15-14-740, and TabD also includes a sample provision to grant gifting powers in thegeneraldurablepower ofattorney.</p>\n<p>Paying for the principal’s health care, as authorized by the principal or other legal decision-maker, is covered under section 5. The agent is given standing as a “personal representative” for purposes of HIPAA in order to gain access to the principal’s medical records solely for bill-paying purposes. This section does not authorize the agent to make medical treatment decisions for the principal, however. C.R.S. § 15-14-703(1)(b) states explicitly that this statute does not apply to the power to make healthcare decisions. Instead, powers to make healthcare decisions on the principal’s behalf are governed by C.R.S. §§ 15-14-503,et seq. See Form 4, “Medical Durable Power of Attorney.”</p>\n<p>The form states that the power of attorney is“durable.”Under C.R.S.§15-14-704, a power of attorney executed on or after January 1,is durable unless it expressly provides it is terminated on the incapacity of the principal.This is the reverse from prior law.The form still provides for the power of attorney to remain effective following the disability of the principal, because the laws of other states may still require this phrase to be included.</p>\n<p>This paragraph may instead be written to read:“This power of attorney shall become effective upon the disability of the principal.”This springing power may present a problem in proving the principal’s disability. Evidence of the principal’s disability on which a third party can rely may be described in the instrument. A letter from a treating physician, for example, may be such evidence.See Form 4, “Medical Durable Power of Attorney,”for an example of a designation of the agent as a“personal representative”under HIPAA to obtain information to determine incapacity.The problem with the springing power is providing a mechanism for the agent to determine when it is effective.</p>\n<p>SeeComerica Bank-Tex.v. Tex.CommerceBankNat’l Assoc., 2 S.W.3d 723 (Tex. App. 1999). There is no prohibition against a springingpowerand the court upheld the validity of the power of attorney, notwithstanding that it did not specifically authorize this feature (discussed in 11Prob.Practice Rep.7-8 (Dec. 1999)).</p>\n<p>To convey an interest in real property, a power of attorney must be acknowledged and recorded.SeeC.R.S.§38-30-123. A witness to the principal’s signature is not required in Colorado, but it may be required in other states if this document is used in a state outside of Colorado.</p>\n<p>Under C.R.S.§15-14-705, the principal’s signature on the power of attorney is presumed to be genuine if a notary statement is included.In addition, under C.R.S.§15-14-719, a person that in good faith accepts a purportedly acknowledged power of attorney is protected from liability in acting in reliance upon it.</p>\n<p>Use caution in having an agent signan“Acceptance”section.Under C.R.S.§15-14-714, once an agent has accepted appointment, he or she has duties totake actionon behalf of the principal.C.R.S.§15-14-713 describes when an agent has accepted appointment, which can be altered in the power of attorney.Under prior law, an agent did not have fiduciary duties unless and until the agent actuallytook action.SeeD. Whitmer, “The Durable Power of Attorney: Defining the Agent’s Duties,” 41Colo. Law. 49 (May 2012).</p>\n<p>The following is an alternate clause that can be included in the power of attorney to limit when the agent has “accepted” the office of agent:</p>\n<p>Acceptance of agent.I direct that unless and until my agent takes any affirmative action on my behalf under this instrument, my agent shall not be considered to have accepted the office and fiduciary duties of my agent. Signing an “Acceptance” form with an example signature shall not, by itself, be considered acceptance of the office by my agent.</p>\n<p>The following is a form that could be used for the agent to sign accepting the appointment:</p>\n<p>ACCEPTANCE BY AGENT</p>\n<p>The undersigned agent hereby accepts the delegation of authority set out in thisinstrument, andagrees to carry out the responsibility and fiduciary duties of agent.</p>\n<p>DateAgent’s Specimen Signature</p>\n<p>In the alternative, the following is a form that could be used in conjunction with the above alternate clause, simply to provide an example signature but not acceptance:</p>\n<p>AGENT’S EXAMPLE SIGNATURE</p>\n<p>The undersigned agent acknowledges that the agent is aware of being named as agent by the principal but does not currently accept the office and fiduciary duties of an agent by providing the agent’s example signature below.</p>\n<p>DateAgent’s Example Signature</p>\n<p>Once the agent has accepted the office of agent, C.R.S. § 15-14-714 contains a list of the agent’s duties. The duties listed in (a) below may not be altered by thepower of attorney and include (1) acting in accordance with the principal’s reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and otherwise in the principal’s best interests, (2) acting in good faith, and (3) acting only within the scope of authority granted in the power of attorney.</p>\n<p>The duties listed in (b) below may be changed in the power of attorney. The statutory form power of attorney (seeNote on Use 19) includes a section titled “Important Information for Agent” that outlines the agent’s duties. The practitioner may wish to include similar information for the agent, and discuss the information with the agent, even if the statutory form is not used.SeeNote on Usefor a discussion of ethical issues when the attorney for the principal has discussions with the agent about the agent’s duties. The following is an example of such information.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR AGENT UNDERDURABLE GENERAL POWER OF ATTORNEY</p>\n<p>Financial Powers of Attorney are either effective immediately, meaning an agent has the authority to act on behalf of the principal (person creating Power of Attorney), including signing documents to transfer assets, or they are “springing,” meaning the powers are not in effect until a triggering event, such as a physician signing a letter saying the principal is not able to handle his or her affairs. Either way, an agent named under a Power of Attorney has no duty to exercise the powers granted by the agency until he or she accepts appointment. Once the agent accepts the appointment, he or she must comply with the fiduciary duties conferred upon agents. C.R.S. § 15-14-714.</p>\n<p>a)Agent’s Duties.</p>\n<p>Act in the principal’s best interest with regards to use of the principal’s assets and property for the sole benefit of the principal and never commingle the principal’s property with the agent’s property.</p>\n<p>Keep accurate records of the principal’s finances.</p>\n<p>Act loyally for the principal’s benefit, in good faith, and with care, competence, and diligence.</p>\n<p>Do nothing beyond the authority granted in this power of attorney.</p>\n<p>Endeavor to preserve the principal’s estate plan as known to the agent, so long as it is consistent with the principal’s best interests.</p>\n<p>Disclose your identity as an agent whenever you act for the principal by writing or printing the name of the principal and signing your own name as “agent” in the following manner:</p>\n<p>(Principal’s name) by (Your signature) as agent</p>\n<p>b)Agent’s Powers,Generally.</p>\n<p>Agents are given the authority to make decisions and perform tasks for the principal. A general summary of powers that are often included in the Power of Attorney (and that must be exercised with prudence) are:</p>\n<p>An agent may acquire property, sell property, and manage property on behalf of the principal. Property in this context means real property, bank accounts, vehicles, securities, and personal property.</p>\n<p>An agent may establish, modify, or terminate bank accounts; access safe deposit boxes; and make, assign, or guarantee promissory notes and negotiable instruments on behalf of the principal.</p>\n<p>An agent may have the power to represent the principal in all tax matters for all tax years; such power includes accessing confidential tax information and preparing and signing all tax returns. The IRS may require its own power of attorney form.</p>\n<p>An agent may enter into, modify, or terminate contracts, in any manner with any person for the benefit of the principal.</p>\n<p>An agent may prosecute, defend, settle, or enter arbitration in any matter for the benefit of or against the principal.</p>\n<p>While this is a general list of agent duties and powers, it is not exhaustive. A principal has the authority to define the duties and powers of the agent. Under Colorado law, there are a number of powers a principal may give an agent only by specifically listing those powers in the Power of Attorney. These include powers to:</p>\n<p>Make gifts of the principal’s property on behalf of the principal.</p>\n<p>Create, amend, revoke, or terminate anintervivostrust.</p>\n<p>Create or change rights of survivorship or beneficiary designations.</p>\n<p>Create joint tenancy arrangements.</p>\n<p>Delegate authority granted under the Power of Attorney.</p>\n<p>Exercise powers held by the principal as a fiduciary and as a partner, manager, or member of an entity.</p>\n<p>Disclaim or release a power of appointment and waive the principal’s right as beneficiary of a joint and survivor annuity.</p>\n<p>Appoint a successor or substitute agent.</p>\n<p>An agent should always read the Power of Attorney document to determine the agent’s specific duties and powers granted by the principal. If you have questions regarding your duties as agent, please contact us or other legal counsel. If an agent violates the Uniform Power of Attorney Act, or acts outside the authority granted in the Power of Attorney, the agent may be liable for any damages caused by the violation. The agent’s authority terminates (1) upon the death of the principal; (2) revocation of the Power of Attorney by the principal; (3) legal action for divorce between the agent and the principal (if the agent is the spouse); or (4) upon another limitation as listed in the Power of Attorney.</p>\n<p>The agent may run into problems with third parties (banks, brokerage houses, title companies, etc.) accepting the agent’s directions.The form followingthe Power of Attorney, Form 1B,isa Certification form for the agent to sign.C.R.S.§15-14-720 authorizes third parties to rely on a Power of Attorney that is accompanied by such acertification, andprotects those who have relied on the document from liability.C.R.S.§15-14-720 requires third parties to comply with the agent’s directions after the certification has beenprovided, andlists the damages for not complying with the agent’s directions, which may include the cost of obtaining court appointment of a conservator. The certification form is included in C.R.S.§15-14-742.</p>\n<p>The new Act contains a statutory form that replaces the prior statutory form that was found in C.R.S.§§15-1-1301 through -1317.The following is the statutory form found in C.R.S.§15-14-741.</p>\n<p>STATE OF COLORADO</p>\n<p>STATUTORY FORM POWER OF ATTORNEY</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</p>\n<p>This power of attorney authorizes another person (your agent) to make decisions concerning your property for you (the principal).
