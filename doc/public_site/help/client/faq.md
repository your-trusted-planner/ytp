# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about using Your Trusted Planner.

## Account & Access

### How do I reset my password?
Go to **Profile** (from the user menu in top-right) and click **Change Password**. Enter your current password and your new password.

### I forgot my password - how do I reset it?
On the login page, click "Forgot Password" and follow the instructions sent to your email.

### How do I update my contact information?
Go to **Profile** and update your details. Click **Save** when done.

### Can I log in with Google or Microsoft?
If your attorney has enabled social login, you'll see options like "Continue with Google" on the login page. You can use these to log in with your existing accounts.

### Who can see my information?
Only your attorney and their authorized staff can access your information. Your data is secure and confidential. External advisors (like CPAs) can only see information they've been specifically granted access to.

## Documents & Signatures

### Are electronic signatures legally valid?
Yes. Electronic signatures are legally binding under federal and state law (ESIGN Act and UETA). They are accepted by courts and government agencies.

### How do I sign a document?
1. Open the document (from email link or portal)
2. Review the content carefully
3. Click "Sign Document"
4. Draw your signature with mouse or touchscreen
5. Click "Confirm & Apply Signature"

### How do I know if I've signed everything?
Check **My Documents** - documents showing "Signed" or "Completed" status have been successfully signed.

### Can I get paper copies?
You can download PDFs of all your signed documents. The PDF includes your signature embedded in the document. If you need physical copies, contact your attorney's office.

### My signing link expired - what do I do?
Contact your attorney's office. They can send you a new signing link with an extended deadline.

### Can I change my signature?
Each time you sign a document, you draw a new signature. You can make your signature look however you want, but it should be consistent with how you normally sign.

## Journeys & Progress

### How long does the process take?
This depends on your specific matter and how quickly required documents are completed. Your attorney can provide an estimate.

### What if I'm stuck on a step?
Contact your attorney's office. They can help you understand what's needed.

### Can I work on multiple journeys?
Yes, if you're enrolled in multiple services, you can view and work on all of them from your dashboard.

### What's the difference between a Matter and a Journey?
A **Matter** is your overall engagement with the firm (like "Smith Family Trust 2024"). A **Journey** is the step-by-step process for completing a specific service within that matter.

## Uploads

### What file types can I upload?
You can upload PDF, JPG, PNG, and DOCX files up to 10MB each.

### How do I know if my upload was accepted?
After uploading, your attorney's office reviews the document. You'll receive a notification about the result: Approved, Requires Revision, or Rejected.

### My upload keeps failing - what should I do?
- Make sure the file is under 10MB
- Try a different file format (PDF usually works best)
- Check your internet connection
- Contact your attorney's office if problems persist

## Technical Issues

### I'm not receiving email notifications
Check your spam/junk folder. If emails still aren't arriving, update your email address in your Profile or contact your attorney's office.

Try using a mouse instead of a touchpad, or use a touchscreen device. You can also try a different browser.
