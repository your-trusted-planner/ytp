  - Profile page calendar management buttons (Set Primary, Deactivate, Delete) are still disabled/TODO

### Recently Completed ✅

#### Form Builder System (2026-03-24 / 2026-03-25)
- **Status**: Complete ✅ (core system — standalone forms, journey integration, and migration utility are remaining phases)
- **What**: Full form builder with visual editor, 14 field types, conditional logic, person field mappings, 12-column grid layout, multi-step sections, and rich text content blocks with TipTap editor.

**Schema Changes** (`server/db/schema/forms.ts` — new file):
  - `forms`: form definitions with name, slug, type, multi-step toggle, settings JSON
  - `formSections`: ordered sections within forms (pages in multi-step mode)
  - `formFields`: 14 field types with config JSON, conditional logic, person field mapping, colSpan (1-12 grid)
  - `formSubmissions`: responses with context FKs to bookings, appointments, action items, matters, journeys, persons
  - `formId` added to `appointmentTypes` and `publicBookings`
  - `maritalStatus` added to `people` table

**Core Logic** (`app/utils/form-logic.ts`):
  - `evaluateConditions()` — 6 operators (eq, neq, contains, not_contains, is_empty, is_not_empty) with all/any matching and show/hide actions
  - `validateField()` — required, email, phone, number min/max, select option validation
  - `validateSection()` — validates only visible fields (hidden required fields don't block)
  - `extractPersonFields()` — extracts mapped person data from responses
  - 53 unit tests covering all logic paths

**Admin APIs** (16 endpoints):
  - Form CRUD: `GET/POST /api/admin/forms`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/forms/[id]`
  - Bulk definition save: `PUT /api/admin/forms/[id]/definition` — atomic replace of all sections + fields
  - Section CRUD + reorder under `/api/admin/forms/[id]/sections/`
  - Field CRUD + reorder under `/api/admin/form-fields/`

**Field Components** (14 types in `app/components/form/fields/`):
  - Registry pattern: `FieldType → Component` map for dynamic rendering
  - Simple inputs: Text, Textarea, Email, Phone, Number, Date
  - Choice fields: Select, MultiSelect, Radio, Checkbox, YesNo (button toggle)
  - Special: FileUpload (drag-and-drop), Scheduler (embeds SlotPicker), Content (renders sanitized HTML)

**FormRenderer** (`app/components/form/FormRenderer.vue`):
  - Multi-step section navigation with progress indicator
  - 12-column CSS grid layout with configurable colSpan per field
  - Conditional field visibility evaluated reactively
  - Per-section validation blocking Next until valid
  - Person field extraction and scheduler slot capture on submit

**FormBuilder** (`app/components/form/builder/`):
  - `useFormBuilder` composable for local state management
  - Two-column layout: section list + field config panel (450px)
  - Drag-and-drop field reordering within and across sections
  - FieldConfigPanel: label, required, width, placeholder, help text, options, conditions, person mapping, type-specific config
  - Conditional logic builder with field-aware value dropdowns
  - Fully interactive preview mode

**Rich Text Editor** (`app/components/ui/RichTextEditor.vue`):
  - TipTap-based WYSIWYG: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, text color, highlight, headings, lists, horizontal rules, links, YouTube embeds
  - Source mode toggle for raw HTML editing (branded content)
  - HTML sanitization: scripts stripped, iframe domains whitelisted, event handlers removed

**Settings & Booking Integration**:
  - `/settings/forms` — card grid, create modal, full-screen edit modal with FormBuilder
  - Form selector dropdown in appointment type settings
  - `/book/[slug]` and `/book/[slug]/[staffSlug]` render FormRenderer when `formId` is set
  - Person lookup/creation from form field mappings via record-matcher
  - Legacy questionnaire path fully preserved

**Additional Improvements** (2026-03-24):
  - QuickAddPerson inline component with duplicate detection (`useDuplicateCheck` composable, `DuplicateWarning` component)
  - Per-day multi-window business hours for appointment types (replaces single-window)
  - InternalSlotPicker for appointment modal availability checking
  - `POST /api/people/quick-add` endpoint (STAFF-accessible)
  - STAFF role added to `GET/POST /api/people` endpoints
  - Copy icon on appointment type slug cards

**Test Coverage** (53 new tests):
  - `tests/unit/forms/form-logic.test.ts` — condition evaluation, validation, person field extraction

#### Google Calendar Integration — Phase 1 & 2 (2026-03-18)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **What**: Full Google Calendar integration with team dedup view, appointment CRUD with Google sync, and unified Google Workspace settings.

**Schema Changes** (`server/db/schema/appointments.ts`):
  - `appointments`: added `googleCalendarEventId`, `googleCalendarEmail`, `matterId`, `appointmentType` (6 types), `attendeeIds` (JSON), `createdById`; `clientId` now nullable
  - `publicBookings`: added `selectedSlotStart`, `selectedSlotEnd`, `timezone`

**Google Calendar Utility** (`server/utils/google-calendar.ts`):
  - Expanded scope to full `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
  - Added KV token caching (55-min TTL) via `getCachedAccessToken()`
  - Credentials now read from DB (`googleDriveConfig` table) first, fall back to env vars — shared with Drive
  - Added `listCalendarList()`, `isServiceAccountConfigured()`, typed `FreeBusyPeriod` return
  - `getFreeBusy()` now returns parsed busy periods instead of raw API response

**New API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/calendar/events` — team calendar with dedup logic (groups shared Google events by ID, builds avatar stacks)
  - `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/calendar/appointments` — CRUD with Google Calendar sync + activity logging
  - `GET /api/public/booking/availability` — free/busy slot calculation for public booking
  - `POST /api/public/booking/book-slot` — double-book prevention, creates appointment + Google event

  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/calendars` — admin calendar management
  - `GET /api/admin/google-workspace/status` — unified integration status
  - `POST /api/admin/google-workspace/test-credentials` — service account auth test (no Drive ID required)

**New Utility** (`server/utils/availability.ts`):
  - `calculateAvailableSlots()` — pure function generating 30-min interval slots within business hours, filtering busy periods

**Activity Logger** (`server/utils/activity-logger.ts`, `activity-description.ts`):
  - Added `APPOINTMENT_CREATED`, `APPOINTMENT_UPDATED`, `APPOINTMENT_CANCELLED` types with descriptions

**Frontend — Pinia Store** (`app/stores/useCalendarStore.ts`):
  - Singleton state for calendar views (replaces composable)
  - 30-second skip-if-fresh caching; CRUD auto-invalidates
  - Shared staff list (fetched once, used by modal + filters)
  - Date navigation, event lookups by day/hour

**Frontend — Components**:
  - `CalendarToolbar` — date nav, week/month/agenda toggle, team/individual toggle
  - `CalendarGrid` — CSS grid week + month views with time slots
  - `CalendarAgenda` — day-grouped list view
  - `CalendarEventCard` — color-coded by type, truncated text, avatar stack
  - `CalendarAppointmentModal` — create/edit form with client search, matter select, staff checkboxes, Google sync toggle
  - `AvatarStack` — overlapping circular avatars with initials fallback
  - `SlotPicker` — date selector + available time slot buttons for public booking
  - `BookingConfirmation` — confirmation display with .ics download

**Frontend — Pages**:
  - `/schedule` — full rewrite: toolbar, grid/agenda views, event detail modal, create/edit/cancel
  - `/appointments` — enhanced with modal and calendar link
  - `/settings/google-workspace` — new tabbed page (Service Account, Drive, Calendars) replacing separate pages
  - `/settings/google-drive` — refactored to remove credentials (now in Workspace), back-link updated
  - `/book/[bookingId]` — new dynamic-route booking page with payment/schedule/confirmation flow
  - `/profile` — fixed Add Calendar button (was in nonexistent slot), gated behind service account config

**Bug Fixes**:
  - `server/api/attorney/calendars/index.post.ts` — `requireRole` was destructured incorrectly (`{ user }` vs direct return)
  - `server/api/client/appointments.get.ts` — fixed broken query builder chaining
  - `server/api/appointments/index.post.ts` — `clientId` made optional to match schema
  - `server/api/admin/google-drive/configure.post.ts` — `isEnabled` made optional (defaults false) for partial saves
  - `server/api/admin/google-drive/test.post.ts` — merges form values with stored config instead of requiring all fields
  - `app/pages/settings/google-drive.vue` — hydration fix (load status in `fetchConfig` instead of relying on store SSR state)
  - `app/pages/profile/index.vue` — `ClientOnly` wrapper for calendar section to avoid hydration mismatch
  - `CalendarEventCard` — `overflow-hidden min-w-0` to prevent text from blowing out grid columns
  - `CalendarEventCard` — renamed `click` emit to `select` to fix event propagation

**Test Coverage** (92 new tests across 5 files):
  - `tests/unit/calendar/availability.test.ts` (23 tests) — slot generation, busy filtering, durations, business hours, edge cases
  - `tests/unit/calendar/activity-descriptions.test.ts` (8 tests) — appointment description generation

  - `tests/unit/calendar/booking-validation.test.ts` (20 tests) — booking state machine, double-book prevention

#### Derived Client Status via SQL View (2026-03-06)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **What**: Client status is now derived from matter activity at the data level using a `clients_with_status` SQL view, replacing the static `status` column that was hardcoded during import. Uses legal-ethics-compliant labels:
  - **PROSPECTIVE** (Rule 1.18) — no open matters; consulting about possible representation
  - **ACTIVE** (Rules 1.6–1.8) — at least one open matter; currently represented
  - **FORMER** (Rule 1.9) — all matters closed; representation ended

- **Architecture**: Read View + Write Table pattern
  - SQL view `clients_with_status` computes status live from `matters` table via join path: `clients.person_id → users.person_id → users.id → matters.client_id`
  - API read endpoints (`index.get.ts`, `[id].get.ts`) use the view; write endpoints keep using the physical `clients` table
  - No app-level recalculation hooks needed — the view computes status on every query

- **Changes**:
  - `server/db/schema/clients.ts` — added `clientsWithStatus` view definition with table-qualified column references to avoid SQLite ambiguity in correlated subqueries
  - `server/api/clients/index.get.ts` — reads from view, status filter updated to `['PROSPECTIVE', 'ACTIVE', 'FORMER']`
  - `server/api/clients/[id].get.ts` — reads from view
  - `server/api/clients/[id].put.ts` — removed manual status editing (status is derived)
  - `server/api/clients/index.post.ts` — Zod enum updated to `['PROSPECTIVE', 'ACTIVE', 'FORMER']`, default `'PROSPECTIVE'`
  - `server/queue/lawmatics-import.ts` — import default changed from `'ACTIVE'` to `'PROSPECTIVE'`
  - `app/pages/clients/index.vue` — status filters and badge variants updated
  - `app/pages/clients/[id].vue` — status badge updated, status removed from edit form
  - `app/pages/clients/new.vue` — both save buttons use `'PROSPECTIVE'`
  - `server/db/seed/clients.ts` — seed data updated to use new enum values
  - Test suite updated across 4 files (mock types, factories, API tests, architecture tests)

#### Lawmatics Parallel Operation — Sync Protection & Tests (2026-02-27)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **What**: Implemented all 5 phases of the Lawmatics Parallel Operation plan — ownership guards, field-level edit tracking, sync metadata management, scheduled sync infrastructure, and admin sync UI. Added comprehensive test coverage for the sync protection business logic.

**Sync Protection Logic** (in `server/utils/lawmatics-upsert.ts`):
  - `parseExistingMetadata` — safely parse importMetadata JSON
  - `canSyncUpdateRecord` — ownership guard: skip YTP-native records, source mismatches, and YTP-owned overrides
  - `filterLocallyModifiedFields` — field-level protection: skip fields edited locally in YTP
  - `buildSyncedMetadata` — refresh sync timestamp and snapshot while preserving all existing metadata

**Sync Metadata Tracking** (new `server/utils/sync-metadata.ts`):
  - `isImportedRecord()` — check if a record came from an external system
  - `getLocallyModifiedFields()` — retrieve list of locally edited fields
  - `detectChangedFields()` — compare existing vs incoming values with null/empty normalization
  - `markFieldsAsLocallyModified()` — DB function to track field edits on imported records

**ImportMetadata Schema Extensions** (in `server/utils/lawmatics-transformers.ts`):
  - Added `sourceOfTruth?: 'LAWMATICS' | 'YTP'` — explicit ownership override
  - Added `locallyModifiedFields?: string[]` — fields edited in YTP that sync should skip
  - Added `lastSyncSnapshot?: Record<string, any>` — Lawmatics values at last sync for conflict review

**API & UI Changes**:
  - `server/api/clients/[id].put.ts` — calls `markFieldsAsLocallyModified` on save
  - `server/api/people/[id].put.ts` — calls `markFieldsAsLocallyModified` on save
  - `server/api/clients/[id].get.ts` — returns `importMetadata` for sync status display
  - `server/api/people/[id].get.ts` — returns `importMetadata`
  - `server/api/matters/[id].get.ts` — returns `importMetadata`
  - `app/pages/clients/[id].vue` — sync status badge integration
  - `app/pages/matters/[id].vue` — sync status badge integration
  - `app/components/ui/SyncStatusBadge.vue` — new component showing sync source, last sync time, locally modified fields

**Admin Sync Infrastructure**:
  - `server/api/admin/sync/` — admin endpoints for sync management
  - `server/api/admin/integrations/index.get.ts` — updated for sync status
  - `server/plugins/scheduled-sync.ts` — scheduled sync plugin
  - `app/pages/settings/integrations/lawmatics/index.vue` — expanded Lawmatics settings with sync controls
  - `wrangler.jsonc` — updated with sync-related bindings

**Test Coverage** (69 new tests across 3 files):
  - `tests/unit/integrations/sync-protection.test.ts` (25 tests) — ownership guards, field filtering, metadata building
  - `tests/unit/integrations/sync-metadata.test.ts` (32 tests) — imported record detection, locally modified fields, change detection, field tracking integration
  - `tests/unit/integrations/sync-ownership.test.ts` (12 tests) — end-to-end sync decision flow: YTP-native skip, source mismatch, YTP override, full update, partial update with protected fields, all-fields-protected with metadata refresh

#### WealthCounsel Import - Person Deduplication & UI (2026-01-26)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **What**: Added comprehensive person deduplication to WealthCounsel import with a review UI
- **Problem**: When importing estate plans from WealthCounsel XML, people could be created as duplicates if they already existed in the system. Also, the same person could appear multiple times in plan roles.
- **Solution**:
  - **Person Matching Utilities**: Extracted reusable matching logic to `server/utils/person-matching.ts`
    - `PersonExtractor` class for batch extraction with role aggregation
    - `calculateMatchConfidence()` - Confidence scoring (SSN=99%, NAME_EMAIL=95%, NAME_DOB=85%, NAME_ONLY=60%)
    - `findPersonMatches()` / `findPersonMatchesBatch()` - Database matching
    - `buildDecisionLookup()` / `buildPersonIdLookupFromDecisions()` - Decision handling
  - **Person Matching UI**: Created Vue components for user review
    - `app/components/person/ConfidenceBadge.vue` - Badge showing match confidence with color coding
    - `app/components/person/MatchCard.vue` - Card for individual person with matches and radio buttons

    - Added deduplication in `transformRoles()` based on `(personId, roleType, forPersonId)` tuple
    - Prevents same person having same role type multiple times in a plan
- **Files Created**:
  - `server/utils/person-matching.ts` - Reusable matching utilities
  - `app/components/person/ConfidenceBadge.vue` - Match confidence badge
  - `app/components/person/MatchCard.vue` - Person match selection card
  - `app/components/person/MatchingReview.vue` - Person matching review container
  - `tests/unit/person-matching.test.ts` - 42 tests for matching utilities
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/api/admin/integrations/wealthcounsel/parse.post.ts` - Uses PersonExtractor
  - `server/api/admin/integrations/wealthcounsel/import.post.ts` - Handles person decisions
  - `server/api/admin/integrations/wealthcounsel/pending/[parseId].get.ts` - Returns extractedPeople
  - `server/utils/wealthcounsel-transformers.ts` - Role deduplication fix

- **UI Features**:
  - Filter tabs by role type (client, spouse, child, beneficiary, fiduciary) or "with matches"
  - Quick actions: "Accept all high-confidence matches", "Create all new"
  - Role-based color coding (client=blue, spouse=pink, child=purple, beneficiary=green, fiduciary=amber)
  - Import summary showing create vs link counts

#### Lawmatics Import - Comprehensive Duplicate Handling (2026-01-26)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **What**: Implemented duplicate detection for contacts during Lawmatics import to prevent cascade failures
- **Problem**: When a contact was skipped (duplicate OR filtered as non-person), it wasn't added to the lookup cache. This caused cascade failures:
  ```
  Contact skipped (duplicate) → NOT in peopleLookup
    → Prospect referencing that contact → FAILS (can't find person)
      → NOT in matterLookup
        → Notes referencing that prospect → FAILS (can't find matter)
  ```
- **Solution**:
  - **Duplicate Detection**: New `server/utils/duplicate-detector.ts` with email-based duplicate detection
    - `buildEmailIndex()` - Builds email→personId index from people table at start of contacts phase
    - `checkForDuplicates()` - Checks each contact against the index before transform
    - Returns match info with confidence score (100 for exact email match)
  - **Critical Fix**: When duplicate found, add to `peopleLookupCache` with **existing person's ID**
    ```typescript
    peopleLookupCache.set(record.id, duplicateCheck.bestMatch.existingPersonId)
    ```
  - **Duplicate Tracking**: New `import_duplicates` table logs all detected duplicates for review
    - Source record info (externalId, entityType, sourceData JSON)
    - Match info (duplicateType, matchingField, matchingValue, confidenceScore)
    - Resolution tracking (LINKED, CREATED_NEW, SKIPPED, PENDING)
  - **Real-time Index Update**: Newly created contacts added to email index to catch duplicates within same batch
- **Files Created**:
  - `server/utils/duplicate-detector.ts` - Duplicate detection utilities
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/db/schema.ts` - Added `importDuplicates` table
  - `server/queue/lawmatics-import.ts` - Integrated duplicate detection in contacts phase
  - `server/api/admin/migrations/[id].get.ts` - Added `duplicatesLinked` count to response
  - `app/components/admin/MigrationProgress.vue` - Shows duplicates linked count (amber stat box)
  - `app/pages/settings/integrations/lawmatics/migrate.vue` - Updated interface for duplicatesLinked
- **Key Insight**: "By adding the duplicate to the lookup cache with the existing person's ID, all downstream prospects and notes will resolve correctly instead of failing"
- **Migration**: `0013_dizzy_maverick.sql` - Creates `import_duplicates` table
- **Future Enhancements** (not in this version):
  - Full duplicates list endpoint (`GET /api/admin/migrations/[id]/duplicates`)
  - Manual resolution endpoint (`POST .../duplicates/[id]/resolve`)
  - Review modal with side-by-side comparison

#### Lawmatics Import Fix - Prospects Processing (2026-01-24)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **What**: Fixed issue where all prospects/matters failed to import with "Could not resolve client for prospect" error
- **Root Cause**: Contacts were imported into the `people` table (correct per Belly Button Principle), but prospects processing was looking up clients in the `users` table, which was empty
- **Solution**:
  - Added `buildPersonToUserMap()` function to map personId → userId for existing user accounts
  - Added `ensurePersonIsClient()` function that:
    - Looks up person in people table
    - Creates `users` record with role='CLIENT' if not exists
    - Creates `clients` record if not exists
    - Returns userId for matter's clientId FK reference
  - Updated prospects processing to use peopleLookup + ensurePersonIsClient
  - Cache personToUserMap entries so multiple matters for same client reuse the same user
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/queue/lawmatics-import.ts` - Added new helper functions and updated prospects case
- **Tests Created**:
  - `tests/unit/lawmatics-import-prospects.test.ts` - 22 regression tests covering:
    - Contact to Person to Client flow
    - Multiple matters for same client (key regression scenario)
    - Error handling for orphan prospects
    - Import metadata generation
    - buildPersonToUserMap logic
    - ensurePersonIsClient logic
    - Prospects phase processing integration
- **Key Insight**: "By definition, a person who has a matter associated with them is a client" - so we look up contacts in people table, then promote them to client/user when they have a prospect

#### Server-Side Pagination for Index Endpoints (2026-01-24)
- **Status**: Complete ✅

  - `limit` - Items per page (default: 25, max: 100)
  - `sortBy` - Column to sort by
  - `sortDirection` - 'asc' or 'desc'
- **Response Format**:
  ```typescript
  {
    clients: [...],
    pagination: {
      page: 1,
      limit: 25,
      totalCount: 150,

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Domain Model (Current State)

**Core Entities**:
- **People**: Individuals and entities with contact info, identity fields, and middle names support
- **Clients**: References a Person, tracks engagement status
- **Matters**: Primary unit of engagement (with client), has title, status, description
- **Service Catalog**: Template services (WYDAPT, Maintenance, etc.) with pricing
- **matters_to_services**: Junction table linking engaged services to matters
- **Client Journeys**: Multi-step workflows tied to matters and services
- **Journey Templates**: Reusable workflow definitions
- **Payments**: Tracked at matter level (planned UI implementation)
- **Documents**: Attached to matters (planned UI implementation)

**Key Relationships**:
```
Client (1) ──→ Person (1)
Matter (N) ──→ Client (1)
Matter (N) ←─→ Service Catalog (N) via matters_to_services
Journey (N) ←─→ Service Catalog (N) via journeys_to_catalog
Client Journey (N) ──→ Matter (1)
Client Journey (N) ──→ Journey (1)
Client Journey (1) ──→ Service Catalog (0..1) via selectedCatalogId (for ENGAGEMENT journeys)
Payment (N) ──→ Matter (1)
Document (N) ──→ Matter (1)
```

### Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- Nuxt 4 + NuxtHub (Cloudflare-based)
- Drizzle ORM with custom types
- SQLite (D1) database
- API routes in `/server/api/`

**Frontend**:
- Vue 3 Composition API
- TailwindCSS + custom UI components
- Progressive disclosure patterns for complex forms

**Document Generation**:
- docxtemplater for template rendering (output side)
- Future: Schema extraction architecture (input side - see below)

## 🔮 Future Work

### ~~0. SEMGREP Security Scanning~~ ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-10)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- Semgrep Cloud Platform integration is active
- Fixed 2 XSS vulnerabilities identified by Semgrep scans
- Created `useSanitizedHtml` composable for reusable XSS protection
- Branch protection can be configured to require Semgrep checks before merge

### ~~1. Development Seed Data Improvements~~ ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-10)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- See "Comprehensive Seed Data & Auto-Seeding" in Recently Completed section above
- All requirements met: users, matters, journeys, documents, people, relationships
- Auto-seeding on empty database for zero-config development startup

### 1. Schema Extraction Architecture
- **Status**: Documented, not implemented
- **Doc**: `/doc/future-schema-extraction-architecture.md`
- **Goal**: Extract template schemas from Word documents to auto-generate journey steps
- **Key Insight**: docxtemplater covers ~20% (document generation/output), schema extraction covers ~80% (document analysis/input)
- **Phases**:
  1. Template parsing and field extraction
  2. Domain model mapping (Trust, Person, Relationships)
  3. Human review and refinement UI
  4. Code generation for journey components
  5. Journey template creation
- **Philosophy**: Prefer domain models over custom fields, avoid "swiss army knife" custom field proliferation

### 2. Trust Domain Model
- **Status**: Conceptual discussion, not implemented
- **Goal**: First-class Trust entity with proper relationships
- **Why**: Estate planning specific, can hard-code domain knowledge
- **Fields**: Trust name, type, settlor(s), trustee(s), beneficiaries, formation date, jurisdiction
- **Benefits**: Type-safe journey steps, better data integrity, reduced custom fields

### 3. Payment Management UI (Phase 3)
- **Status**: Database table exists, no UI yet
- **Need**: Record payments, view payment history, calculate balances
- **Location**: Matter detail view (Payments tab)

### ~~4. Toast Notifications & UI Polish~~ ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-21)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **Implementation**: vue-toastification with custom Tailwind styling
- See "Google Drive Integration, Toast Notifications & Notices System" in Recently Completed section
- `useToast()` composable available globally with `success()`, `error()`, `warning()`, `info()` methods
- **Remaining polish** (optional future work):
  - Replace remaining `alert()` calls with toast notifications
  - Improve tooltip styling (currently using native `title` attributes)
  - Audit loading states across the app

### 5. API Token Authentication
- **Status**: Planned
- **Problem**: No programmatic API access - only session-based authentication via UI
- **Why**: Enable external integrations, testing, automation, and third-party service access
- **Use Cases**:
  - Integration with external CRM/practice management systems
  - Automated document generation workflows
  - Third-party client portals
  - Testing and development convenience
  - Zapier/Make.com integrations
- **Scope**:
  - **API key generation**: Allow users to create API keys with optional scopes/permissions
  - **API key management UI**: View, create, revoke, and regenerate keys
  - **Token-based auth middleware**: Validate `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - **Rate limiting**: Protect endpoints from abuse
  - **Audit logging**: Track API usage for security and debugging
  - **API documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all endpoints
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Tokens should have scopes (read-only, read-write, admin)
  - Tokens should be revocable
  - Tokens should have expiration dates (optional)
  - Rate limiting per token
  - IP allowlisting (optional)
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Tokens stored hashed in database (like passwords)
  - Middleware checks both session auth and token auth
  - Existing endpoints work with both auth types
  - New `/api/api-keys/*` endpoints for key management

### 6. API Case Convention Refactor (snake_case → camelCase)
- **Status**: Planned (requires coordinated effort)
- **Problem**: Mixed conventions in API responses due to migration from raw SQL to Drizzle ORM
  - Some endpoints return snake_case (`first_name`, `created_at`)
  - Some return camelCase (`firstName`, `createdAt`)
  - Some return BOTH for backward compatibility
- **Goal**: Standardize all API responses to camelCase
- **Scope**:
  - Audit all API endpoints for response format
  - Update frontend components to use camelCase consistently
  - Remove snake_case fallbacks after frontend migration
- **Why coordinated effort**: Changing API response shapes breaks frontend components expecting the old format
- **Approach**:
  1. Inventory all endpoints with snake_case responses
  2. Update frontend components endpoint-by-endpoint
  3. Remove snake_case from backend after frontend updated
  4. Test each endpoint/component pair before moving to next
- **Documentation**: See CLAUDE.md "Attribute Case Conventions" section for current rules
- **DO NOT** attempt opportunistic cleanup - requires frontend + backend changes together

### 7. Estate Plan Administration Features (Phase 7)
- **Status**: Documented, not implemented
- **Context**: Phases 1-6 of estate plan management are complete (import, display, CRUD, status transitions). Phase 7 covers post-death administration workflows.
- **Goal**: Enable attorneys to manage estate plan administration after grantor death/incapacity
- **Features**:
  - **Status Transition Workflows UI**: Modal/button in plan detail to change status (API exists, needs UI)
  - **Enhanced Distribution Recording**: Add `distributionAmount`, `distributionDescription`, and beneficiary selection to Add Event modal
  - **Add Role Modal**: Replace placeholder with full working modal for adding trustees, beneficiaries, agents, etc.
  - **Create Administration Matter**: Button/flow to create a new matter linked to the plan for administration work (uses `planToMatters` table with `ADMINISTRATION` relationship type)
  - **Auto-Notifications**: Create notices when status changes or key events occur (notices schema exists, needs integration)
- **Backend Status**:
  - ✅ `PUT /api/estate-plans/:id/status` - State machine API ready
  - ✅ `POST /api/estate-plans/:id/events` - Events API with distribution fields in schema
  - ✅ Role CRUD APIs ready
  - ✅ `POST /api/matters` - Matter creation API ready
  - ✅ `planToMatters` table with ADMINISTRATION relationship type
  - ✅ `notices` / `noticeRecipients` tables exist
  - ❌ No API to create notices programmatically
- **Frontend Status**:
  - ❌ No status transition UI (button/modal)
  - ⚠️ Add Event modal lacks distribution amount/beneficiary fields
  - ❌ Add Role modal is placeholder only
  - ❌ No "Create Administration Matter" button
  - ❌ No auto-notification integration
- **Why Deferred**: This is more like an epoch than a sprint - significant UI work across multiple components

### ~~8. Journey-Matter Workflow Fix~~ ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-10) (was #7)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **Implementation**: Auto-start service journeys when engagement journey completes
- When ENGAGEMENT journey completes, automatically creates client journeys for all engaged services
- Backend already validates matter-service engagement before manual journey creation
- See `server/api/client-journeys/[id]/advance.post.ts`

### ~~7. Enhanced Matter List View~~ ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-10)
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- Added search input (title, matter #, client name)
- Added status filter (All/Open/Pending/Closed)
- Added client filter dropdown
- Added "Clear filters" button
- See `app/pages/matters/index.vue`

### ~~8. Client Experience Improvements~~ ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED (2026-01-10)
- **Status**: Security fix complete, card layout deferred
- Created secure `/api/my-matters` endpoint (returns only client's matters)
- Fixed security issue where clients could see all matters
- Card-based layout is optional polish for future

### 9. Client/People Schema Cleanup - Derived vs Stored Booleans
- **Status**: Planned (requires data model review)
- **Problem**: Several boolean fields in the `clients` and `people` schemas store data that can become stale or could be derived from relationships
- **Problematic Fields**:
  - `has_minor_children` - Can be derived from `relationships` table where `relationshipType='CHILD'` and the child person's `dateOfBirth` indicates they're under 18
  - `has_will` / `has_trust` - These are point-in-time snapshots that become stale. Could be derived from `documents` or `estate_plans` tables
- **Why This Matters**:
  - Boolean values stored at intake time become stale as circumstances change
  - If a child turns 18, `has_minor_children` doesn't automatically update
  - If we create a trust document for a client, `has_trust` isn't automatically updated
  - Maintaining these manually is error-prone and creates data inconsistency
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  1. **Derive from relationships**: Query `relationships` + `people.dateOfBirth` to compute `hasMinorChildren` at read time
  2. **Derive from documents/plans**: Query `estate_plans` or `documents` with type='TRUST' to compute `hasTrust`
  3. **Remove booleans entirely**: Replace with computed properties in API responses
  4. **Keep as "initial intake" fields**: Rename to `hadMinorChildrenAtIntake` to clarify they're historical snapshots
- **Migration Considerations**:
  - Need to ensure relationships are created when children are added during intake
  - May need to backfill relationships from existing `childrenInfo` JSON field
  - Frontend intake form should create relationship records, not just set booleans
- **Related**: The `childrenInfo` JSON field should probably become proper `relationships` + `people` records
- **Priority**: Medium - affects data integrity long-term but current implementation works for intake
- **Design Tension - Intake Simplicity vs Data Integrity**:
  - At intake, staff only need to know *whether* there are minor children, not the details
  - Forcing full child entry (name, DOB, relationship record) at intake creates friction
  - But storing only a boolean means the data becomes stale and disconnected from the relationship model
  - **This tension will recur** for other "do you have X?" intake questions (existing trust, business ownership, etc.)
  - **Possible pattern**: Two-phase data capture
    1. **Intake phase**: Capture boolean flags as "signals" for what detailed data will be needed
    2. **Matter/Journey phase**: Journey steps prompt for full details, creating proper relationship records
    3. **Reconciliation**: Once detailed records exist, the boolean becomes redundant (or is computed)
  - **Alternative pattern**: "Quick add" vs "Full add"
    - Boolean flag enables a "quick note" that children exist
    - Later, a dedicated UI collects full child records and clears/replaces the boolean
  - **Key insight**: The boolean isn't wrong at intake - it's the right level of detail for that moment. The problem is treating it as the permanent source of truth rather than a temporary placeholder

### 11. UX Polish Backlog (from 2026-04-22 Review Session)
- **Status**: Planned
- A collection of UX improvements identified during review with Chris. None require schema changes; all are frontend/layout adjustments.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Journey progress indicators | Add a visual completion percentage/progress bar to journey cards on the client and staff dashboards. |
| Client dashboard: pending actions above the fold | Surface pending journey action items prominently on the client's initial dashboard view (not buried in journey sub-pages). Anything the firm is waiting on the client for should be visible at first login. |
| Action items prominence on matter detail | Matter info currently dominates the `/matters/[id]` page. Action items panel should move up / be given higher visual weight. |
| Client name + link in matter header | Matter detail page header should show the client name as a clickable link back to the client record. |
| Form field pre-population | When a journey/action item form has fields mapped to a person record (e.g., email, phone), pre-populate from the existing DB value. Decide: read-only with edit button, or always editable. |
| Form completions on record pages | Form submission responses should be surfaced in the related record's UI (a "Forms" tab or section on matter, client, or person pages) — not only accessible via the form builder admin. |
| Google Drive button gated by email domain | Admin configures a list of allowed email domains. Only users whose email matches see the "Open in Google Drive" button. Prevents confusing the button for clients. |
| Signatures in client nav + matter overview | Add "Signatures" to the client portal sidebar. Also add a quick-link or status badge to the matter Overview tab. |
| Journey completion view audit | Audit what the client sees vs. what staff sees when a journey is completed. Ensure clients get a clear confirmation/summary and staff can see what was submitted. |
| My Companies view | Client portal page (`/my-companies`) listing entity records (trusts, LLCs, etc.) associated with the client. Depends on entity schema (item 14 below). |
| Relationship affirmation prompts | Periodic prompt (journey step or scheduled message) asking clients to confirm their current relationships are still accurate. "Still married? Any new children since your last review?" |

### 12. Joint Representation / Couple Intake
- **Status**: Planned (requires data model design)
- **Problem**: The current "New Client" flow adds one person as a client. Married couples receiving a joint estate plan are two co-clients on a single matter. There is no intake path or data model for this.
- **Open Questions**:
  - Does the `matters` table get a second `clientId`, or do we introduce a `matterClients` junction table?
  - How does the client portal handle a matter shared by two people?
  - How does billing work for joint matters (one invoice, two trust ledgers)?
- **Scope**:
  - Data model decision: `matterClients` junction vs. expanded `matters` row
  - "Add a Couple" intake path: create two people, link as spouses via `relationships`, associate both as clients on the matter
  - UI: matter header shows both client names; client portal shows the shared matter for both users
  - Conflict-check implications: both people must pass conflict check before matter is opened

### 13. Entity Schema — Trusts, LLCs, Corporations
- **Status**: Partially designed, not implemented
- **Context**: CLAUDE.md describes a plan to represent non-person entities (trusts, LLCs, corporations, partnerships) as `people` records with `personType='entity'`. This exists in the schema definition but there is no intake UI, no entity-specific metadata, and no dedicated views.
- **Scope**:
  - Schema: confirm `personType='entity'` is the right approach vs. a separate `entities` table; add entity-specific fields (jurisdiction, formation date, EIN via TIN pattern, registered agent)
  - Intake UI: "Add Entity" form with type selector (trust, LLC, corporation, partnership, etc.)
  - Trust bridge table: trust-specific metadata (trust type, governing law, revocable/irrevocable) that doesn't fit `people`
  - Relationships: link entities to people (e.g., member of LLC, trustee of trust) via the existing `relationships` table
  - My Companies view (client portal): list entities associated with the logged-in client (see UX Backlog above)
- **Note**: This is partially described in `CLAUDE.md` and the entity schema memory. The `personType` field already exists in the `people` table.

### 14. Invite Person to Portal
- **Status**: Planned
- **Problem**: To give a person access to the client portal, staff must navigate to User Management and create a user account manually. There is no "Invite" flow from the Person record itself.
- **Scope**:
  - "Invite to Portal" button on the person detail page and as a row action on the people list
  - Checks if the person already has a `users` record (prevent duplicate)
  - Creates the user record (role=CLIENT) and sends an email with a set-password link
  - Invite email copy TBD — should reflect the firm and the nature of the portal
  - Open question: should the user's profile in the portal reflect their relationship type (e.g., "You are listed as the spouse of Jane Smith")?

### 15. LawPay Integration, Recurring Billing & Client Portal Payments
- **Status**: Planned (feature cluster — can be phased)
- **Why**: The billing/trust accounting system is built but uses only internal payment recording. Clients cannot pay online, and there is no subscription/recurring billing support.
- **Phase A — LawPay Integration**:
  - Connect LawPay account via admin settings (API key / OAuth)
  - Payment links on invoices (clients click → LawPay hosted page)
  - Webhook to mark invoices paid and record trust deposits automatically
  - LawPay is widely used in legal (compliant with IOLTA rules)
- **Phase B — Client Portal Payments**:
  - Client portal page: view open invoices, pay via LawPay
  - Trust balance visible to client (read-only)
  - Payment confirmation / receipt email
- **Phase C — Recurring Charges**:
  - Maintenance plan subscriptions: monthly/annual billing for ongoing services (document review, Q&A, etc.)
  - Auto-generates invoices on schedule
  - Subscription status tracking (active, paused, cancelled)
- **Phase D — State Entity Compliance Subscription**:
  - Track state filing deadlines (annual reports, registered agent renewals) for clients with business entities
  - Could be a recurring service type or a standalone compliance calendar module
  - Alerts/reminders when deadlines approach

### 16. Engagement Letter as a Top-Level Concept
- **Status**: Planned (requires design)
- **Problem**: Engagement letters are currently treated as generic documents. There is no dedicated send flow, no status tracking (sent / signed / active), and no enforcement that a matter has a signed engagement letter before work begins.
- **Scope**:
  - Engagement letter as a distinct document subtype or first-class record (`engagementLetters` table or `documentType='ENGAGEMENT'`)
  - Send flow from the matter: select template → generate → send for signature in one action
  - Status: Draft → Sent → Signed → Active
  - Matter overview shows engagement letter status badge
  - Optional: block matter from OPEN status until engagement letter is signed (configurable gate)
  - Engagement letter history: all versions for a client over time
- **Note**: This surfaced because "Send a document for signature" from a matter just navigates to `/documents` with no context — fixing that UX (bug #5 above) is a prerequisite.

### 10. US Address Validation API
- **Status**: Planned
- **Problem**: Address fields are currently free-form text with no validation
- **Goal**: Validate US addresses against USPS database for accuracy and deliverability
- **Use Cases**:
  - Client intake forms - ensure mailing addresses are valid
  - Estate plan documents - proper legal addresses for trusts, property descriptions
  - Notarization workflows - verify signer addresses
  - Marketing/mail campaigns - reduce returned mail
- **Implementation Options**:
  - **USPS Web Tools API** (free, requires registration) - Address standardization and verification
  - **SmartyStreets/Smarty** (paid) - Higher rate limits, better UX, autocomplete
  - **Google Places API** (paid) - Autocomplete with validation
  - **Lob Address Verification** (paid) - Simple API, good for verification-only
- **Scope**:
  - API endpoint to validate/standardize addresses
  - Client-side composable for address input with validation
  - Optional address autocomplete component
  - Store both entered and standardized address versions
- **Database Consideration**: May want to add `addressStandardized` field or expand address to structured format (street1, street2, city, state, zip, plus4)

### 17. Reusable Modal Form Audit
- **Status**: Planned (code quality / DX)
- **Problem**: Several pages contain large inline modal forms with duplicated markup and logic (search state, submit handling, reset on close). The `AddRelationshipModal` refactor (April 2026) revealed this pattern; others likely exist.
- **Scope**: Scan all `pages/` and `components/` for `<UiModal>` blocks that contain non-trivial forms. For each, evaluate whether the form appears in more than one place or is complex enough to warrant extraction. Candidates likely include: matter creation, note creation, document upload, appointment booking, trust/entity creation.
- **Goal**: Each extracted component should own its own state, loading, and error handling (via `onSave` prop or `save` emit) so the parent only provides context and a callback.

### 19. Replace native confirm() dialogs with UiConfirmDialog
- **Status**: Planned (UX / in progress)
- **Problem**: ~20 uses of native browser `confirm()` across `app/pages/`. These block the thread, can't be styled, and look inconsistent with the app's design.
- **Component**: `app/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.vue` — already built. Props: `title`, `message`, `confirmText`, `cancelText`, `variant` (`danger` | `default`), `loading`.
- **Pattern**: Replace `if (!confirm('...')) return` with a `showXxxDialog` boolean + `confirmXxx()` async handler wired to `@confirm`. The dialog manages its own loading state while the delete is in flight.
- **First replacement done**: Remove Relationship on `clients/[id].vue` (April 2026).
- **Remaining**: `billing/time-entries.vue`, `matters/[id].vue`, `journeys/[id].vue` (×3), `people/[id].vue`, `people/index.vue`, `invoices/[id].vue` (×2), `profile/index.vue` (×4), `settings/integrations/` (×5).

### 18. Search-Instead-of-Select Audit
- **Status**: Planned (UX)
- **Problem**: Several `<select>` dropdowns load full lists that grow unwieldy as data accumulates (people, clients, services, templates, etc.). The Add Relationship modal was the most recent example — a 300+ person dropdown replaced with a debounced search.
- **Scope**: Scan all `<UiSelect>` / `<select>` elements whose options are populated from an API call. For each, check if the list is bounded (e.g., US states, a fixed enum) or unbounded (people, clients, matters, services). Unbounded lists should become search-as-you-type inputs.
- **Pattern to apply**: Text input → debounced (300ms) → API call with `?search=X&limit=10` → inline dropdown results → selected value displayed below input. Reference implementation: `app/components/relationships/AddRelationshipModal.vue`.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Tomorrow)

### If continuing API normalization work:
1. Run the application and test features
2. If you encounter fields showing as undefined/null in UI:
   - Find the corresponding API endpoint (check browser network tab)
   - Open the endpoint file (e.g., `/server/api/.../something.get.ts`)
   - Look for `.all()` or `.get()` calls on Drizzle queries
   - Add snake_case conversion mapping (see pattern in Technical Decisions Log)
   - Convert Date objects to timestamps: `item.createdAt instanceof Date ? item.createdAt.getTime() : item.createdAt`
   - Convert booleans to integers: `item.isActive ? 1 : 0`
3. Reference examples:
   - `/server/api/matters/index.get.ts` - Simple list conversion
   - `/server/api/journeys/index.get.ts` - Enriched data with aggregates
   - `/server/api/documents/[id].get.ts` - Complex nested objects
4. **Priority order**: Fix endpoints as UI features are tested/used (on-demand approach)

### ~~If resuming UI restructuring work:~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- UI restructuring plan is complete (all phases done)
- See `/Users/owenhathaway/.claude/plans/lexical-plotting-wadler.md` for summary

### If continuing People/middle names work:
- Feature is complete! No further work needed unless testing reveals issues.

### If starting schema extraction:
1. Review `/doc/future-schema-extraction-architecture.md`
2. Clarify scope: Which phase to start with?
3. Consider building Trust domain model first (provides target for extraction)

## 🎯 Custom Fields Philosophy

**Principle**: Thoughtful, tightly integrated custom fields - not swiss army knife proliferation

**Guidelines**:
- UI should scan for existing domain model fields before creating custom fields
- Prefer hard-coded domain models (Trust, Person+Relationships) over generic custom fields
- Estate planning specific → can hard-code domain knowledge
- Schema extraction should suggest domain model mappings, not just create custom fields
- Human review step maps extracted fields → domain models

**Why**: Prevents custom field sprawl, maintains data integrity, enables type-safe journeys

## 📊 Technical Decisions Log

### 2026-01-07: API Response Normalization Strategy
- **Decision**: Systematically convert all Drizzle ORM responses to snake_case at API layer
- **Context**: NuxtHub 0.10.x migration + Drizzle ORM adoption revealed field name mismatch
- **Problem**: Drizzle returns camelCase, existing UI expects snake_case from old raw SQL days
- **Solution**: Map all API responses to include both camelCase and snake_case (backwards compatible)
- **Pattern**:
  ```typescript
  return items.map(item => ({
    id: item.id,
    fieldName: item.fieldName, // camelCase for new code
    field_name: item.fieldName, // snake_case for existing UI
    createdAt: item.createdAt instanceof Date ? item.createdAt.getTime() : item.createdAt,
    created_at: item.createdAt instanceof Date ? item.createdAt.getTime() : item.createdAt
  }))
  ```
- **Scope**: All GET endpoints using `.all()` or `.get()` (~96 files identified)
- **Progress**: 26 high-priority endpoints completed, ~70 remaining
- **Rationale**: Gradual migration path, no UI changes required, prevents display bugs

### 2026-01-06: ORM-Layer Serialization
- **Decision**: Move JSON serialization from API layer to ORM layer
- **Implementation**: Drizzle custom types (e.g., `jsonArray`)
- **Benefit**: Cleaner API code, automatic handling, reusable pattern
- **Pattern**: Use for any JSON data in TEXT columns

### 2026-01-06: Progressive Disclosure for Middle Names
- **Decision**: Simple single input by default, expandable to multiple
- **Rationale**: "The vast majority of people have only one middle name, if any" (user quote)
- **Implementation**: Toggle flag + automatic reversion when reducing to 0-1 names
- **Pattern**: Reuse for other rare-but-needed complexity

### Prior: Matter-Centric Domain Model
- **Decision**: Matters are primary unit of engagement (not services)
- **Implementation**: Junction table `matters_to_services`, journeys reference matters
- **Migration**: Complete at database level, UI catch-up in progress

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. ~~**No Payment Management UI**~~: ✅ RESOLVED - Full billing & trust accounting system implemented (2026-01-28)

2. **Date of Birth Off By One Day**: DOB displays one day earlier than stored, likely a timezone issue. JS `Date` parses a date-only string (e.g., `1975-04-15`) as UTC midnight, which rolls back a day in Mountain Time. Fix: parse DOB as a local date, not UTC.

3. **Reciprocal Relationships Not Displaying**: When a relationship is added in the New Client flow, the reciprocal side (e.g., if A is the spouse of B, B should show A as spouse) does not appear. Suspected data issue — the relationship may only be written in one direction. The unified `relationships` table should store or infer both directions. Needs investigation.

4. **Ghost Duplicate Services on Matter**: When adding a service to a matter, duplicate entries appear in the list. Likely a double-insert on the `matters_to_services` junction table (e.g., optimistic UI + server response both appending). Needs investigation of the add-service endpoint and frontend handler.

5. **"Send for Signature" Links to Documents Page Instead of Matter Flow**: From the matter detail page, "Send a document for signature" navigates to `/documents` with no pre-selected context. Should instead open a targeted send-for-signature modal pre-scoped to the current matter.

6. **Google Drive E2E Test Failures**: Several Google Drive-related E2E tests are failing due to configuration/mock issues:
   - Tests in `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts` that involve Google Drive sync status
   - Tests expecting Drive folder creation during matter creation
   - **Root Cause**: E2E tests don't have proper Google Drive API mocking or test credentials configured
   - **Impact**: Low - Google Drive integration works in development/production with proper credentials
   - **TODO**: Add proper E2E test fixtures for Google Drive integration or skip Drive-related assertions in E2E tests

## 💬 Notes from Last Session

**Session 2026-02-27**:
- **Focus**: Lawmatics Parallel Operation — all 5 phases implemented + test coverage
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Sync ownership guards in `lawmatics-upsert.ts` (skip YTP-native, source mismatch, YTP-owned records)
  - ✅ Field-level edit protection (locally modified fields preserved during sync)
  - ✅ Sync metadata management (timestamps, snapshots, field tracking)
  - ✅ New `server/utils/sync-metadata.ts` with pure utility functions + DB tracking function
  - ✅ Extended `ImportMetadata` type with `sourceOfTruth`, `locallyModifiedFields`, `lastSyncSnapshot`
  - ✅ PUT endpoints for clients and people now call `markFieldsAsLocallyModified`
  - ✅ GET endpoints return `importMetadata` for sync status display
  - ✅ New `SyncStatusBadge.vue` component
  - ✅ Admin sync infrastructure (endpoints, scheduled plugin, settings UI)
  - ✅ 69 unit tests for sync protection business logic (3 test files)
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Tests simulate private helper function logic inline (no DB mocking needed)
  - `isImportedRecord` and `getLocallyModifiedFields` imported and tested directly
  - `detectChangedFields` normalizes null/undefined/empty string as equivalent
  - Tests committed separately from implementation — CI failed because `sync-metadata.ts` and `ImportMetadata` changes were not yet committed
- **Files Created**:
  - `server/utils/sync-metadata.ts`
  - `app/components/ui/SyncStatusBadge.vue`
  - `server/api/admin/sync/` (directory with endpoints)
  - `server/plugins/scheduled-sync.ts`
  - `tests/unit/integrations/sync-protection.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/integrations/sync-metadata.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/integrations/sync-ownership.test.ts`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/utils/lawmatics-upsert.ts` — added 4 sync protection helpers, integrated into all upsert functions
  - `server/utils/lawmatics-transformers.ts` — extended ImportMetadata type
  - `server/api/clients/[id].put.ts` — field tracking on save
  - `server/api/people/[id].put.ts` — field tracking on save
  - `server/api/clients/[id].get.ts`, `server/api/people/[id].get.ts`, `server/api/matters/[id].get.ts` — return importMetadata
  - `app/pages/clients/[id].vue`, `app/pages/matters/[id].vue` — sync badge integration
  - `app/pages/settings/integrations/lawmatics/index.vue` — sync controls
  - `app/types/matter.ts` — importMetadata field
  - `server/api/admin/integrations/index.get.ts` — sync status
  - `wrangler.jsonc` — sync bindings

**Session 2026-01-27**:
- **Focus**: Estate plan delete functionality and activity logging integration

  - ✅ Added 5 estate plan activity types (CREATED, UPDATED, AMENDED, IMPORTED, STATUS_CHANGED)
  - ✅ Added activity descriptions for estate plan events
  - ✅ Integrated activity logging into WealthCounsel import endpoint
  - ✅ Added delete button and confirmation modal to estate plan detail page
  - ✅ Created 32 unit tests for delete functionality
  - ✅ Fixed CI test failure by using lazy imports for `@nuxthub/db` in person-matching.ts
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Delete uses query params (not body) for `deletePeople` option due to Cloudflare Workers DELETE body issue
  - People deletion is attempted individually to handle cases where people have other relationships
  - Confirmation requires typing exact plan name to prevent accidental deletion
  - Activity logging captures full deletion summary for audit trail
- **Files Created**:
  - `server/api/admin/estate-plans/[id].delete.ts`
  - `tests/unit/estate-plan-delete.test.ts`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/utils/activity-logger.ts` - Estate plan entity type and activity types

  - `app/pages/estate-plans/[id].vue` - Delete UI

**Session 2026-01-26**:
- **Focus**: Lawmatics import duplicate handling to prevent cascade failures
- **Problem Solved**: Duplicates and non-person contacts were skipped without adding to lookup cache, causing hundreds of note import errors
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Created `server/utils/duplicate-detector.ts` for email-based duplicate detection
  - ✅ Added `import_duplicates` table to track detected duplicates for review
  - ✅ Integrated duplicate detection into contacts phase of queue handler
  - ✅ Critical fix: Add duplicates to `peopleLookupCache` with existing person's ID
  - ✅ Updated email index in real-time as new contacts are processed
  - ✅ Added `duplicatesLinked` count to migration run API response
  - ✅ Added amber "Duplicates Linked" stat box to migration progress UI
  - ✅ Updated documentation in CURRENT_STATUS.md
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Email index built once at start of contacts phase (efficient O(1) lookups)
  - Duplicates logged to `import_duplicates` table with full source data JSON
  - Resolution tracking supports future manual review/resolution UI
  - Real-time index update catches duplicates within same import batch
- **Key Insight**: "By adding the duplicate to the lookup cache with the existing person's ID, all downstream prospects and notes will resolve correctly"
- **Files Created**:
  - `server/utils/duplicate-detector.ts`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/db/schema.ts` - Added `importDuplicates` table
  - `server/queue/lawmatics-import.ts` - Integrated duplicate detection

- **Migration**: `0013_dizzy_maverick.sql` (already generated)

**Session 2026-01-24**:
- **Focus**: Server-side pagination and Lawmatics import fix
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Created server-side pagination utility (`server/utils/pagination.ts`)
  - ✅ Created frontend pagination composable (`app/composables/usePaginatedData.ts`)
  - ✅ Added pagination UI to UiDataTable component
  - ✅ Updated 4 backend endpoints (clients, people, matters, referral-partners)
  - ✅ Updated 3 frontend pages (clients, people, matters)
  - ✅ Created 19 unit tests for pagination utilities
  - ✅ Fixed Lawmatics import - prospects were failing because contacts imported as people but lookup used users table
  - ✅ Added `buildPersonToUserMap()` and `ensurePersonIsClient()` functions
  - ✅ Created 22 regression tests for Lawmatics import fix
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Pagination is backward compatible - endpoints without params return all data
  - Multiple matters for same client now reuse the same user account (cached in personToUserMap)
  - Contacts imported as people are promoted to client/user when they have a prospect/matter
- **Key Insight**: "By definition, a person who has a matter associated with them is a client"
- **Files Created**:
  - `server/utils/pagination.ts`
  - `app/composables/usePaginatedData.ts`
  - `tests/unit/pagination.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/lawmatics-import-prospects.test.ts`
- **Files Modified**:

  - ✅ Notifications page with full history
  - ✅ Official Google Drive icon component
  - ✅ Lucide icons plugin for global icon registration
  - ✅ Fixed client sync status not persisting after page refresh
  - ✅ Fixed lawyers endpoint missing await and camelCase fields
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Google Drive API requires `supportsAllDrives: true` for Shared Drive operations
  - Service account with impersonation acts as the impersonated user (sees their drives)
  - JWT authentication uses Web Crypto API (compatible with Cloudflare Workers)
  - Drive credentials stored in database for admin-manageable configuration
  - Notices support both user-specific and role-broadcast targeting
- **Files Created** (key ones):
  - `/app/plugins/toast.client.ts` - Toast plugin

  - ✅ Fixed CSS overflow on /clients page (`min-w-0` on flex children)
  - ✅ Added E-Signatures navigation item to dashboard sidebar
  - ✅ Added toast notifications and UI polish to roadmap
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Resend API key format: `re_...` (not UUID format)
  - Blob access: Use `import { blob } from 'hub:blob'` not deprecated `hubBlob()`
  - Flexbox overflow: `min-w-0` overrides implicit `min-width: auto`
- **Plan Status**: E-Signature Phases 1-3 complete, Phases 4-5 (KYC, ESIGN action items) remain for future
- **Next Up**: Toast notifications system, Payment Management UI, or continue with Enhanced Signature (Phase 4)

**Session 2026-01-10 (Late Evening)**:
- **Focus**: RBAC Testing Infrastructure & Page Restructuring
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Created centralized route configuration (`shared/routes.ts`)

  - `tests/e2e/rbac.spec.ts` - Role-based access control E2E tests
  - `tests/unit/routes.test.ts` - Route configuration unit tests
- **Why**: Attorney-client privilege requires comprehensive access control verification
- **Test Results**: 46 E2E tests passing, 61 route unit tests passing, 34 RBAC unit tests passing

**Session 2026-01-10 (Evening)**:
- **Focus**: Semgrep Security Fixes & UI Restructuring Completion
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Fixed 2 Semgrep XSS findings (`v-html` vulnerabilities)
  - ✅ Created `useSanitizedHtml` composable for reusable DOMPurify sanitization
  - ✅ Suppressed noisy stderr in template-renderer error tests
  - ✅ Auto-start service journeys when engagement journey completes
  - ✅ Added filters/search to matter list (search, status, client)
  - ✅ Created secure `/api/my-matters` endpoint for clients
  - ✅ Evaluated and completed UI restructuring plan
- **Files Created**:
  - `app/composables/useSanitizedHtml.ts`
  - `server/api/my-matters/index.get.ts`
- **Key Decision**: Journey automation vs manual start - design calls for auto-start when engagement completes, not manual "Start Journey" UI
- **Plan Status**: UI restructuring plan marked COMPLETED

**Session 2026-01-10 (Morning)**:
- **Focus**: Seed Data Improvements & Auto-Seeding
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Comprehensive seed data with 8 users, 3 matters, journeys, documents, relationships
  - ✅ Real DOCX content from `doc/word_document_templates/` parsed and stored
  - ✅ Documents now have DOCX blobs in R2 storage (not just templates)

  - ✅ Auto-seeding on first request when database is empty (dev only)
  - ✅ New `server/utils/template-upload.ts` utility for reusable DOCX processing
  - ✅ Fixed deprecated `hubBlob()` across 6 files (now auto-imported `blob`)
  - ✅ Migration 0059 to fix column naming (counsel_approved → attorney_approved)
  - ✅ Updated README.md with modern quick-start guide
- **Developer Experience**:
  - `pnpm dev` + open browser = fully seeded database ready to test
  - No manual seed step required for fresh development
  - Test accounts documented in README.md
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Auto-seed uses `nitroApp.hooks.hookOnce('request', ...)` to ensure migrations run first
  - Seed reads DOCX files from filesystem, processes with template-upload utility
  - Documents get copies of template DOCX blobs with unique paths

**Session 2026-01-09**:
- **Focus**: Activity Logging System & Role Structure Clarification
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Activity logging system with request context capture
  - ✅ Referral partner management (CRUD APIs)
  - ✅ Marketing event and registration tables
  - ✅ Activity feed component and full activity log page
  - ✅ Navigation link to Activity Log for firm members
  - ✅ STAFF role added (internal firm employees like paralegals, secretaries)
  - ✅ ADVISOR role clarified (external third-parties with limited access)
  - ✅ RBAC utilities updated with `isFirmMember()` function
  - ✅ User management UI updated with STAFF option
  - ✅ Tests updated for new role structure
- **Role Structure (Clarified)**:
  - FIRM_ROLES: `['ADMIN', 'LAWYER', 'STAFF']` - Internal employees with broad access
  - ADVISOR: External third-parties (CPAs, financial advisors) with LIMITED access
  - CLIENT_ROLES: `['CLIENT']` - Engaged clients
  - PROSPECT_ROLES: `['PROSPECT', 'LEAD']` - Not yet engaged
- **Database Migration**: `0024_large_gertrude_yorkes.sql` (activities enhancement + new tables)

**Session 2026-01-08 (Evening)**:
- **Focus**: Firebase Authentication integration with OAuth providers
- **Achievements**:
  - ✅ Full Firebase Authentication implementation (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook support)
  - ✅ Automatic account linking by email
  - ✅ OAuth-only user support (nullable password field)
  - ✅ Role-based navigation refactored for better configurability
  - ✅ Admin UI for OAuth provider management
  - ✅ Fixed hydration mismatches from password manager extensions (LastPass)
  - ✅ Added provider logos to `/public/icons/`
  - ✅ Profile page conditionally shows password section based on user auth type
- **Technical Challenges Solved**:
  - Firebase Admin SDK JSON parsing (Nuxt auto-parses env vars)
  - Password NOT NULL constraint for OAuth users (migration to make nullable)
  - SSR hydration mismatches (ClientOnly wrapper for forms)
  - Role-based navigation for different user types (ADMIN, LAWYER, CLIENT, PROSPECT, etc.)
- **Current State**:
  - Firebase OAuth working end-to-end with Google provider tested
  - Session management working across page navigations
  - Navigation shows only relevant items for user's role
  - Clean console (no Vue warnings except LastPass extension noise)
- **End of Session**: Documentation updated, SEMGREP added to roadmap

**Session 2026-01-07** (Previous):
- Completed NuxtHub 0.10.x migration
- Fixed document downloads and DOCX generation
- Converted 26 API endpoints to snake_case format

**Session 2026-01-06** (Previous):
- Multiple middle names functionality completed
- Action items & task management system implemented

---

**Next Session Options**:
1. **Payment Management** - Build payment recording UI (separate plan needed)
2. **Schema extraction** - Begin document template analysis and journey generation
3. **Replace remaining alert() calls** - Audit and migrate to toast notifications
4. **Continue API normalization** - Fix remaining ~70 endpoints as features are tested (on-demand)
5. **Matter deletion** - Implement delete functionality (deferred from this session)

## 📋 Future Considerations

### PDF/A Compliance for Signed Documents
- **Status**: Documented for future consideration
- **Context**: When implementing signed PDF generation, considered PDF/A (ISO 19005) for long-term archival
- **Decision**: Start with standard PDF using `pdf-lib` - legally sufficient under ESIGN/UETA
- **Why PDF/A might be needed later**:
  - Some government agencies require PDF/A for submissions
  - Financial institutions may require it for compliance
  - Long-term archival guarantees (fonts embedded, no external dependencies)
- **Implementation options if needed**:
  - Manual PDF/A metadata with pdf-lib (complex)
  - Server-side conversion via Adobe PDF Services API
  - Alternative library with native PDF/A support
- **Current approach**: Standard PDF with embedded signature, audit trail, and document hash is legally binding and tamper-evident for most use cases
